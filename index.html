**Platform Overview**  
**Title:**  
The MDC Framework

**Body:**  
MDC stands for Metal-Drug Complex - a novel therapeutic architecture based on selective metal-ligand dynamics. These complexes:
- Reprogram drug activity
- Enable multivalent molecular interactions
- Enhance tissue-specific targeting and bioactivity

MDC operates at the intersection of coordination chemistry and programmable biology. It is not just a drug - it's a system of logic built from atoms.

**Key Features:**
- Ligand-controlled activity switching
- Scaffold flexibility across molecular targets
- Built for RNA, protein, or receptor-level modulation through mechanisms such as metal ion chelation to stabilize or disrupt active sites, structural interference with protein folding or RNA secondary structures, and signal amplification via redox or conformational shifts at the molecular interface

**Application Zones**  
**Title:**  
Strategic Use Cases

**Teasers:**  
- **Antiviral Constructs** - Disrupt viral replication or capsid assembly via targeted coordination chemistry.
- **RNA Regulatory Interfaces** - Chemically influence RNA folding, translation, or decay.
- **Neurochemical Modulators** - Cross BBB with precision ligands to target inflammation or ion channels.

> MDC is in early-stage development across these zones. Custom complex design is available under NDA, including tunable metal cores (e.g., Zn, Cu, Fe), ligand customization for binding specificity or stability, and scaffold variation for organ- or target-specific activity.

**Partner With Us**  
**Title:**  
We're Engaging Chemists, Biotech Engineers, and System Thinkers

**Body:**  
MDC is entering its deployment phase, with current efforts focused on preclinical validation, in vitro assays, and strategic compound profiling across antiviral and neurochemical use cases. We seek aligned minds in:
- Molecular and RNA chemistry
- Advanced drug delivery
- Synthetic and programmable biology

We prioritize focused collaboration, IP integrity, and purpose-driven work.

**Licensing & Future Security**  
We offer:
- Exclusive licensing per drug
- Milestone-based agreements
- MDC-as-a-Service for biotech R&D labs

As the platform evolves, MDC will incorporate next-generation encryption tags, molecule provenance tracking, and endpoint-to-endpoint verification using quantum-resistant hashing for future pharmacological cybersecurity.
